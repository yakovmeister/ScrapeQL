# ScrapeQL

Probably the most stupid idea ever, a scraping tool with a bit of a familiarity of SQL syntax.



### First off: Why do this?

- Because I can?
- I like the idea of SQL syntax in scraping
- I'm bored



### Versions: (currently it is still incomplete)



#### 1.0.0-alpha1 

- can scrape but not accurate yet
- SQL syntax yet to be implemented
- init
