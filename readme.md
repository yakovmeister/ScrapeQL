# ScrapeQL

Probably the most stupid idea ever, a scraping tool with a bit of a familiarity of SQL syntax.



### First off: Why do this?

- Because I can?
- I like the idea of SQL syntax in scraping
- I'm bored



### Versions: (currently it is still incomplete)


#### 1.0.0-alpha2

- removed empty tags
- sql syntax based operators are removed from Struct.php
- applied regex tweak, still didn't improve accuracy 
- Test File updated

#### 1.0.0-alpha1 

- can scrape but not accurate yet
- SQL syntax yet to be implemented
- init
